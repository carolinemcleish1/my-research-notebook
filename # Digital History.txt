# Digital History
Ever since I took my first digital history course I’ve been interested in the way that technology can aid in the distribution of historical research. I believe that there will be a stronger emphasis on historians to share their information in order to speed up the publishing process. This shift will allow data to be stored and categorized in a way that will be easier to access. My previous course focused on using current social media applications in order to get real time results. This allowed me get vital data to support my thesis that otherwise wouldn’t have been available.

Through this course I’m hoping to learn more about the variety of tools and resources available for use. While I enjoy the integration of digital history my current understanding of the newest software available is a bit lacking. It also doesn’t help that I’m borderline illiterate when it comes to operating a computer and the programs on them.

Due to this I’m hoping that this course will introduce me to a variety of tools that are available for students in order to enhance my own research.
